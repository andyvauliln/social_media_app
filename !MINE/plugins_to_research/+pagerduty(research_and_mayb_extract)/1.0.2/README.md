## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com) v1.0.33 or later

### 1. Add the marketplace

Run this once in any Claude Code session:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add pagerduty/claude-code-plugins
```

### 2. Browse and install plugins

Open the plugin manager and go to the **Discover** tab to browse available plugins:

```bash
/plugin
```

Or install a plugin directly:

```bash
/plugin install pagerduty@pagerduty-claude-code-plugins
```

### 3. Configure API key

The plugins bundle a PagerDuty MCP server that needs an API token. Git commit history is read directly from the local repository.

**Option A: Per-repo via `.claude/settings.local.json`** (recommended)

This file is gitignored by default, so secrets stay local:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "PAGERDUTY_API_KEY": "your-pagerduty-token"
  }
}
```

If the file already exists, merge the `env` key into it.

**Option B: Global via `~/.claude/settings.json`**

This applies the key to all projects:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "PAGERDUTY_API_KEY": "your-pagerduty-token"
  }
}
```

If the file already exists, merge the `env` key into it.

> **Note:** You may need to restart VS Code for environment variable changes to take effect.

#### Where to get the token

PagerDuty > User Profile > User Settings > API Access > Create API User Token.

Restart Claude Code after setting the key so the MCP server picks it up.

## Set up for your team

You can configure a repository so team members are automatically prompted to add this marketplace when they trust the project folder. Add the following to your project's `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "pagerduty-claude-code-plugins": {
      "source": {
        "source": "github",
        "repo": "pagerduty/claude-code-plugins"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

To also auto-enable specific plugins for the project:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "pagerduty-claude-code-plugins": {
      "source": {
        "source": "github",
        "repo": "pagerduty/claude-code-plugins"
      }
    }
  },
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "pagerduty@pagerduty-claude-code-plugins": true
  }
}
```

## Managing plugins

Update the marketplace to get the latest plugins:

```bash
/plugin marketplace update pagerduty-claude-code-plugins
```

Disable a plugin without uninstalling:

```bash
/plugin disable pagerduty@pagerduty-claude-code-plugins
```

Uninstall a plugin:

```bash
/plugin uninstall pagerduty@pagerduty-claude-code-plugins
```

## Plugin: Pre-Commit Risk Scoring

A plugin that assesses pre-commit risk by correlating PagerDuty incident history with current code changes.

The `/pagerduty:pre-commit-risk-scoring` command gathers PagerDuty incident data for your service, analyzes your current git diff, and looks for correlations between the areas you are changing and areas that have historically caused incidents. It surfaces active incidents, recent incident patterns, structural risk signals in the diff, and actionable recommendations.

### Usage

With uncommitted changes in your working tree:

```bash
/pagerduty:pre-commit-risk-scoring
```

On first run, the plugin resolves your repository to a PagerDuty service through a fallback chain:

1. Explicit argument passed at invocation (one-time override, not cached)
2. Cached config in `.claude/risk-config.json`
3. Backstage `catalog-info.yaml` annotation (`pagerduty.com/service-id`)
4. Auto-detection by matching the repository name against PagerDuty services
5. Manual input via interactive prompt

The resolved mapping is saved to `.claude/risk-config.json` for subsequent runs.

You can pass a service name as a one-time override. This takes highest priority, skipping cache and auto-detection, and will not update `.claude/risk-config.json`:

```bash
/pagerduty:pre-commit-risk-scoring my-service-name
```

### Output

The command produces a structured risk assessment containing:

- **Active incidents** for the mapped service (highest-priority signal)
- **Incident history** summary over the last 90 days
- **Change analysis** with file-level and structural risk signals
- **Correlation findings** between current changes and past incidents
- **Risk score** from 0 (no risk) to 5 (critical), based on incident correlation and change analysis
- **Recommendations** based on identified risk factors

### Changing the mapped service

Delete `.claude/risk-config.json` and re-run `/pagerduty:pre-commit-risk-scoring` to pick a different service.
