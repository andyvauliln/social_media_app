## What It Does

Once installed, Claude Code can:

- **Review your code** — just say "review my changes" and Claude runs the review for you
- **Compare branches** — "review my branch against main" triggers a branch diff review
- **Review patch files** — point it at any `.patch` or `.diff` file
- **Manage API keys** — create, list, and delete keys for CI/CD
- **Fix issues** — Claude reads the review feedback and offers to apply fixes directly

<!-- ## Demo -->

## Usage

After installing the plugin, just ask Claude naturally:

| What you say | What happens |
|---|---|
| "review my changes" | Reviews uncommitted local changes |
| "review my branch" | Compares current branch against main |
| "review this diff" | Reviews an arbitrary patch file |
| "set up optibot" | Walks you through auth setup |
| "create an API key for CI" | Creates and displays a new API key |

## Authentication

**Interactive** — run `optibot login` to authenticate via browser (90-day token).

**CI/CD** — set `OPTIBOT_API_KEY=optk_...` as an environment variable.

## CI/CD Integration

```yaml
# GitHub Actions
- name: Optibot Review
  env:
    OPTIBOT_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPTIBOT_API_KEY }}
  run: npx optibot review -b main
```

## Uninstalling

```bash
claude plugin uninstall optibot
```
